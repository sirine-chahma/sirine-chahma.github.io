My name is Bruno Grande and I'm a graduate student at SFU. 
I work in Ryan Morin's lab in the Department of Molecular Biology
and Biochemistry. Despite that, I exclusively do computational biology.
In essence, I use computation to answer biological questions. In our lab, 
our questions focus on cancer genomics, a growing field enabled by next-
generation sequencing.
