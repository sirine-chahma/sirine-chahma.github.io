I followed [this lessons](https://github.com/brunogrande/lesson-github-pages/blob/master/lesson/lesson.md) 
to create a personal blog using GitHub Pages. This is an easy (and free) way to 
take control of your online presence. It provides an avenue to share your thoughts
online and a centralized location to link to all of your other accounts online.
